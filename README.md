## (and meme trigger!)

OBS Browser source file that plays videos when mods chat for the first time in a while  

### Instructions

1. Download, unzip. 
2. Add *index.html* file as browser source (local file) in OBS.
3. Place your mp4 files into same folder as index.html file.

The name of your mp4 file must match the name of either a mod or a meme trigger.

i.e. 

If your mod is called bobmitch, your mp4 file should be called bobmitch.mp4  
If your !meme trigger is !meme test, your mp4 file should be called test.mp4  

A test.mp4 file is included, so you can type *!meme test* into chat to test before adding your own.
